The esthetics were poor, and #31 showed signs of Periapical Radiolucency (PARL). After close monitoring for several months, the PARL worsened, and a buccal fistula developed. After treatment options were discussed, extraction and implant therapy was selected by the patient. Treatment aims included: improved esthetic spacing and contours, improved soft tissue health, and removal of any infection associated with the PARL.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2017/04/fe79d2811b991f9238e4a6047022e913.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\"><img src=\"uploads/2017/04/ccd2e6348ae86a0c2e86b1b1b407dc7d.jpg\" alt=\"alt text\">![alt text][]( “#31 presented with vertical fracture and buccal fistula.

After reviewing CBCT data, it was clear that there was not enough buccal-lingual bone thickness for successful implant placement in site #30. A full thickness flap was elevated and CBCT measurements were confirmed. #31 was sectioned, atraumatically extracted, the socket cleaned with a serrated curette, and grafted with Surgical Esthetics OSSIF-i Mineralized Cancellous .25-1mm particulate <a href=\"https://www.ddsgadget.com/biologics/bone-grafting/allografts.html\">allograft</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.ddsgadget.com/biologics/membranes/non-resorbable-membranes.html\">PTFE membrane</a> was sized and placed on the buccal of #30, ensuring coverage past the margin of the defect in all directions. Decortication potholes were made with a high-speed round carbide bur, with copious irrigation, on the buccal of site #30. Once bleeding was induced, a Surgical Esthetics <a href=\"https://www.ddsgadget.com/ossif-i-sem-demineralized-sponge-strip.html\">OSSIF-i Demineralized Sponge Strip</a> allograft (10x6x7mm) that had been hydrated with sterile water for 10 minutes, was placed into the buccal defect. No fixation screws or pins were used. Surgical Esthetics OSSIF-i Mineralized Cancellous .25-1mm particulate allograft was placed surrounding the sponge. The ePTFE membrane then covered the graft material, and was tucked under the lingual flap. Nylon 5-0 monofilament interrupted sutures secured the graft and membrane in place. A simultaneous root-coverage procedure was done on #29, using a bonded-suture technique. We chose not to get primary closure, to preserve the vestibule and maintain the amount of keratinized tissue. ePTFE membrane and sutures were removed after 1 month.</p>\n<p>![alt text][]( “#30 Pontic space with large resorption. #31 extracted atraumatically, and Surgical Esthetics particulate allograft in place.”)](uploads/2017/04/9757b6265988f7da68b9e805c4d483a1.JPG)#30 Pontic space with large resorption. #31 extracted atraumatically, and Surgical Esthetics particulate allograft in place.![alt text][]( “Cortical perforations performed, and Surgical Esthetics allograft sponge strip being placed.
